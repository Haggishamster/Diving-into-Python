# Writing your own Python scripts

As you may be noticing by now, it isn't that convenient to type in all of the commands you would like to use in the IPython interpreter window. 
An alternative to typing in all of the commands you would like to run is the list them in a Python script file.
A Python script file is simple a file containing a list of the command you would like to run, with one command per line, 
and formatted in the same way as if you were to type them in.
